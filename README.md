# Loan Default Prediction Project
This is a machine learning project that I developed to predict loan default using historical data. The goal of the project was to build a predictive model that can help lenders assess the risk of default for new loan applications and make more informed lending decisions.

## Project Overview:
* Data cleaning and preprocessing using Pandas in Python
* Exploratory data analysis using Seaborn and Matplotlib
* Feature engineering and selection to create a final dataset for modeling
* Training and evaluation of various machine learning algorithms using scikit-learn
* Selection of the best-performing model for deployment

## Getting Started:
To use this project, you will need to have Python and the scikit-learn package installed on your computer. You can install scikit-learn using the following command:
```
pip install scikit-learn
```
Once you have scikit-learn installed, you can run the** loandefault.ipynb **file to train and evaluate the machine learning models.

## Project Structure:
The project is organized into the following files and folders:
* **loandefault.ipynb**: the main Python script that contains the machine learning code
* **data**: a folder that contains the **train_u6lujuX_CVtuZ9i.csv** file with the historical loan data
* README.md: this file

## Contents of train_u6lujuX_CVtuZ9i.csv
The **train_u6lujuX_CVtuZ9i.csv** file contains the following information for each loan:
* Loan ID
* Gender
* Married
* Dependents
* Education
* Self-employed
* Applicant Income
* Coapplicant Income
* Loan Amount
* Loan Term
* Credit History
* Property Area
* Loan Status

## Acknowledgements:
I would like to acknowledge the developers of Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, and scikit-learn for making data cleaning, exploration, feature engineering, and modeling in Python easier and more accessible.

## Conclusion:
This project demonstrates the power of machine learning and the importance of data-driven decision making in lending. By predicting loan default using historical data, we can help lenders assess the risk of default for new loan applications and make more informed lending decisions, ultimately benefiting both lenders and borrowers.
